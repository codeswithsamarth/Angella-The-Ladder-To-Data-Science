This Function is named ceaser cipher
it start with three basic input
first command which tells command such to encode or decode
second message it takes message as input
third shift it takes number to be shifted

it contains two function as encrypt and decrypt
the encrypt function takes two parameters such as text and shift number
first the text -> letter -> position is founded through alphabet lists such as
position = alphabet.index(text)
like that
new position is increment by shift value
and new letter again forms the text through position
and at last it is stored to some variable


the decrypt function takes two parameters such as text and shift number
first the text -> letter -> position is founded through alphabet lists such as
position = alphabet.index(text)
like that
new position is decrement by shift value
and new letter again forms the text through position
and at last it is stored to some variable
